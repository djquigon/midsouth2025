The website training is when you present the website directly to the client and provide instructions on how to make basic edits. It is an opportunity to review the site with the client directly. Most often this happens not long after a new site has gone live, but at times web trainings will happen after a site has been live for a long time, or even before it goes live.

Before the website training, review the website and re-familiarize yourself with how it works. Think through and map out exactly which features of the site you will be explaining to the client, and how.

### Web Training Objectives:

-   Before the meeting, create a user with editor-level privileges to use during the training
-   Show them where and how to log in (client user logins will be created after the training)
-   Brief overview of WordPress as a CMS
    -   difference between front-end and back-end
    -   explanation of WP nav bar while logged in
    -   brief overview of the different wp-admin menu tabs
    -   go to a new, blank page
        -   explain the basic fields: title & WYSIWYG editor
        -   explain media library
        -   explain image optimization
        -   explain publish settings (public, private, draft, schedule, etc.)
        -   explain heading tag usage, make a point on not using `<h1>` because it’s reserved for the page title
-   Brief overview of the modules and how our Standard Content feature works
    -   explain what we consider to be a module and the significance of their ability to be re-used on multiple pages/posts
    -   if a module is really only intended to be used in certain areas of a site, account for this in your explanation
-   For any site that features Custom Post types or has a blog, briefly explain the difference between the Archive page & Single pages
    -   the key thing to explain here is where one goes to edit a single post
-   Run through every page on the site, starting with the homepage
    -   this is vital because it allows the developer and client to look at a site together
    -   often, things that are missed in the revision stages are caught here
    -   apologize for the redundancy, but explain the importance of this review
    -   explain every key feature that the client has the ability to edit, on every page
    -   you will reach a point where you’ve already explained each editable feature at least once
        -   pick up the pace from here to avoid dragging the meeting on too long
        -   for redundant pages, you can scroll quickly through both the front and back end to demonstrate that there’s nothing unique that hasn’t already been explained
-   Be mindful of the length of the list of any revisions the client may bring up during the training
    -   it is normal to notice small things that may have gotten missed like a misspelling or incorrect phone number
        -   minor updates like this can even be used for a live demonstration of how to edit a page/post
        -   it is normal to walk out of a web training with a short list of minor revisions
    -   for anything that resembles a change of scope, take notes and share with the account manager after the training
        -   extensive content edits, changes in functionality, etc.
-   Circle back to the back-end, and discuss any features that weren’t discussed while going through sitemap
    -   viewing form entries and the significance of it
    -   the options tab and it’s significance
    -   managing the website menu(s)
    -   the profile tab, and use the password strength as a segue into next item:
-   Creating user(s) for the client
    -   gather email addresses & if necessary, naming convention for usernames
    -   after the meeting, create the users then send them the info
        -   link to log in
        -   username
        -   temporary password
        -   link to change password
    -   send them this information in a way that won’t allow the information to linger in their email inbox
-   Final questions & thanks
-   End meeting and walk them out
    -   do not encourage clients to contact you directly for future edits if asked, emphasize that their main point of contact is still the Project Manager

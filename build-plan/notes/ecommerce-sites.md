## DRAFT IN PROGRESS

### Some notes for things to definitely not leave out:

-   the importance of setting up reCAPTCHA via the official WooCommerce extension
-   remember to exclude all checkout, cart, my-account pages from cache
    -   include any other pages that would be appropriate
-   shipping
-   payment gateways
-   testing live transactions
-   all of the emails that get sent
    -   ensuring a custom verified sender is used
-   etc. etc. etc.

### Developing documentation for this is going to be a huge task. For now, I will continue prioritizing the actual theme build

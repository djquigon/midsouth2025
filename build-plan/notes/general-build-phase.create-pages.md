-   create all pages from sitemap/content document
    -   for sites with a lot of pages, consider using the WP All-Import plugin to bulk-create the pages and automatically include their meta titles & descriptions
-   if necessary, apply the proper page template
-   load up each page with content and images using your previously created ACF modules
-   ensure any images uploaded are properly optimized
-   ensure efficient and accurate use of heading tags
    -   the only `<h1>` should be the page title
    -   the most common subsequent heading tags you will use are `<h2>` and `<h3>`
    -   `<h4>`, `<h5>`, & `<h6>` will rarely be used, if ever
-   ensure inclusion of meta title and description in SEO widget on page

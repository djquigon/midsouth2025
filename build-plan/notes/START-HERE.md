Welcome to _**your**_ build plan. Every website project begins here.

### Here are the phases of each website project, in order:

1. [[pre-build-phase]]
2. [[initial-setup-phase]]
3. [[general-build-phase]]
4. [[revisions-phase]] - M&R team's & Client's
5. [[go-live-phase]]
6. [[post-live-phase]]

Any & all files in the build plan are _**yours**_ to change on a per-project basis. If a broader change needs to be made in the build plan template, raise it as an issue in the Dev L10.

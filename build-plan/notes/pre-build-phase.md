This phase of the project is _**vital**_ because in it you will put together a sort of 'map' that will guide you through the rest of the build.

At the beginning of the website project, you will be assigned several hours to dedicate to this phase. In that time, you will:

## Get the access to whatever you'll need:

-   the design file(s)
-   up-to-date sitemap & content document(s)
-   any necessary plugins, premium or otherwise
-   domain(s) & DNS
-   any other 3rd party services
    -   ex. Payment Gateways, Mail / eNewsletter services, etc.

### Review all of the above & package them into a folder for you to reference throughout the build

---

## Review the official project proposal

-   This document will be on both the NAS & TeamWork

## Review the time goals

-   how many hours are you allotted for the build?
-   by what date does the preview link need to be ready:
    -   for the internal review?
    -   for the client to review?

---

## Take note of anything we're missing:

-   images / content we've yet to receive from the client
-   access to any 3rd party services
-   points of contact
-   _you can even list it out here..._

---

## Prepare for the Pre-Dev meeting:

Bring into the meeting any questions you may have about the items listed above. For example:

-   functionality, standard & advanced
    -   what did the designer use as a reference point?
-   which content & features should be accessible by which user role?
    -   will any custom user roles be necessary?
-   UX questions for the future website editors/admins
-   project time allotment & deadlines
-   premium plugin usage
-   client's background information
-   any questions / concerns you may have regarding:
    -   custom post types, taxonomies, page templates, & their relationships
    -   single view(s) & archive view(s)
    -   meta fields
    -   etc.
-   what exact domain does the client want the new site to live on?
    -   this includes whether or not we're using **www**
-   who are the recipients of each contact form?
-   has the Copywriter already prepared a redirect map for the client's old site?
-   What is the Digital Dept's role in this project, if any?

### Leave the pre-dev meeting with as many of your questions answered as possible.

You need to exit the meeting prepared to move onto the next step of _**this**_ phase: [[pre-build-phase.functionality-map]]

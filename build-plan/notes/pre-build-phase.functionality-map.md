## This file is a blank slate for you to put together your thoughts on how you will approach the web build.

_Start here..._

---

### [[modules-defined]]

---

### Here are some examples of other questions you should ask yourself here:

-   For a given module / feature, is there an exisiting website M&R has built that I can pull from & adapt?
    -   If not, what is the closest module in the Master Theme that I can duplicate & use as starting point?
-   How will I approach the use of any:
    -   Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, & their relationships
    -   Single view(s) & Archive view(s)
    -   Custom page templates
    -   Custom user roles
-   What is a rough but good estimate of how much time a given module / feature will take to build?
-   How will I map out custom Meta Field groups, fields, & sub-fields?
-   What are the menu locations associated with the header & footer?
-   Who will be the recipients of each contact form?
-   What will be needed by the Digital Dept. & how will I approach that?
    -   ex. event tracking, conversions / key events, audiences, etc.

### You should re-visit & update this document every week, at least twice, (at the beginning & end) but ideally more often than that.

##### Ask yourself:

-   from this plan, what have I completed?
-   is there anything that needs to be added to the plan?
-   what is left to complete before moving on to the next phase of project?

##### _**After**_ you've put together a solid map here, you're able to move on to the next phase in the web build process: [[initial-setup-phase]]

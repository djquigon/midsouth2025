After you’ve built out all the components of the site and it functions well on all screen sizes, it is time for both our team & the client to review your progress.

If you've only been working on a local environment up to this point, it's time to push your local website up to the WP Engine environment.

We use [ZiFlow](https://www.ziflow.com/) to manage our review process.

## Internal Review:

-   log into [ZiFlow](https://www.ziflow.com/) and create a preview link for the website
    -   for the first round of internal review, include only the Project Manager
    -   after making their revisions, add copywriter, designer, and another developer to the preview link for a subsequent round of review
    -   provide clear direction on review deadlines
        -   i.e. "please review before EOD Tuesday" etc.
-   work through the list of revisions, and resolve any issues or discrepancies raised by the team
    -   make good use of ZiFlow's version control

## Client Review:

After a preview link has been thoroughly reviewed by the team and you’ve made all the necessary revisions, it can now be sent to the client for further review.

**It is your responsibility to deliver the preview link to the client.**

-   contact the project manager to confirm exactly who on the client's end needs to be sent the preview link
    -   you'll need their email address(es)
-   ensure that the version of the preview link you are sending them is clear of comments from our team, & that the client doesn't have the ability to view previous versions
-   when the client returns feedback, work through any necessary revisions
    -   take quality notes on anything that will require collaboration with client or other internal department
        -   i.e. content needs, graphic needs, functionality questions, etc.

There may be a delay in the client returning revisions that is no fault of our team. In this case of 'in-between' time, there are plenty of tasks in the [[go-live-phase]] that you can get started on.

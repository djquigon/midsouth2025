Similarly to [[the-digital-suite.search-console]], we also want to verify ownership of a site in Bing Webmaster tools. To make this easier, verify ownership of the site with Google Search Console first.

There are multiple verification methods, but lately I've found that the best is:

-   Log into the main M&R Google Account (michaelandrios@gmail.com)
-   Go to [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/about) & log into the michaelandrios@hotmail.com account
-   You're given an option to [sync the 2 services](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/september-2019/Import-sites-from-Search-Console-to-Bing-Webmaster-Tools), which will import every site we own in Google Search Console

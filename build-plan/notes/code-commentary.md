## Always keep in mind that somebody else is going to have to touch your code eventually

-   For any functionality that is remotely advanced &/or niche, efficient use of comments is _**required**_.

-   With Dendron, you're able to create note files that link to other note files.
    -   If a feature is sufficiently complex, we encourage you to create an entirely separate note file that can describe the feature to a developer that has absolutely no context.
        -   You should even include links to relevant files

You certainly don't have to comment every line of code, but you'll find that explaining how something works as you build it will help every developer that works on it after you, **including your future self**.

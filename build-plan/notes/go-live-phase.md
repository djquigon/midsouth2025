You're able to start on certain portions of the Go-Live phase before you get the full approval to go live. Some of the following steps don't need to happen in a particular order, but you should generally aim to do these in the order they're listed.

-   [[quality-control]]
    -   additional steps for [[ecommerce-sites]] _(in progress)_
-   [[go-live-phase.redirects]]
-   [[go-live-phase.security-settings]]

## _**Congratulations!**_ Reaching this point in the process means that your website has gone live.

### Now, it's time to finish strong and take the necessary steps to close the project out.

-   Add the site to [[the-digital-suite.search-console]] & [[the-digital-suite.bing-webmaster-tools]]
    -   Create a reminder for 1 full week after the site has gone live to review the setup of these & the rest of [[the-digital-suite]] of services
-   In the TeamWork project, add a 'Website Live' message that includes the entire M&R Team
    -   this is a morale boost for us all, & also prompts the Scheduling Coordinator to assign a Developer the [[post-live-phase.peer-review]]
-   update [i.mandr](https://i.mandr-group.com/)
    -   start by creating a new 'Site' post
    -   filling out all the meta fields on the back-end will prompt you to create a new 'Domain' post too
        -   for site projects that have multiple domains forwarding to it, create a 'Domain' post for each of them too
    -   **Add list of any premium plugins in use**. Include the name & cost to M&R
-   Make sure any changes regarding plugins, third party services, or other solutions that were in the statement of services are noted in the project overview message, i.mandr, and discussed with the Project Manager as soon as possible
-   Ensure all 3rd party login information & site login information is accessible by the rest of the team
    -   i.e. shared LastPass folders
-   in WP Engine's panel, create a backup point of the site
    -   download the .zip of this backup, and place it on the NAS in the client's folder
    -   create a 'Backups' subfolder and drop the .zip in here
    -   rename it to include the client's name & _**'INITIAL_BACKUP'**_ in the filename
-   Add an "Automatic Screenshot" for the site in WP Engine & remove the site from the 'Not Live' site group
-   Do a couple Google Searches of the client's name & business to test the links in the SERP
    -   create any necessary redirects for broken links

### If you haven't already completed it, prepare for [[website-training]].

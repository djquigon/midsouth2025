Your role as the developer conducting this peer review is important because you serve as a fresh pair of eyes. Your goal is to review the site with a fresh perspective, and report any necessary adjustments in the site's TeamWork project so that the site's developer can make them.

### Start by going through each item listed in the [[quality-control]] document.

In addition to what's listed there, consider the following:

-   **Is the site being indexed properly?**
    -   i.e. the no-index setting is off & the site is properly set up in [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
-   Review the developer's build plan
    -   Did they make good use of the [[pre-build-phase.functionality-map]] ?
-   Focus on the site's main features
    -   from the perspective of the average user, are there any UX improvements that should be made?
    -   review any advanced functionality's code
        -   is it explained well in the code commentary?
        -   is there a Dendron file explaining the feature?
            -   is one necessary?
-   Check [i.mandr](https://i.mandr-group.com/) for accurate site & domain info
    -   are all the features that cost M&R money listed with details?

##### Add a message thread to the site's TeamWork project with your notes from this review

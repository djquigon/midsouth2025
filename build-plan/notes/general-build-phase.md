We're now at the phase where we are actively building the website, piece by piece. There are no strict rules on the exact order of steps you must take, and you'll likely bounce back & forth between or do several of these simultaneously.

Generally you’re going to:

-   [[general-build-phase.site-wide-elements]]
-   [[general-build-phase.build-header]]
-   [[general-build-phase.build-modules]]
-   [[general-build-phase.create-pages]]
-   [[general-build-phase.build-footer]]
-   [[general-build-phase.styling]]
-   [[general-build-phase.front-end-scripting]]
-   Build, configure, & test any [[general-build-phase.contact-forms]]
-   Configure [[the-digital-suite]] of services
-   [[general-build-phase.responsive-design]]

As you're working through this phase of the build, be proactive & consider the [[quality-control]] portion of the Go-Live & Post-Live phases.

Once you've built the website out to be a polished & fully-functional product on all screen sizes, you're able to move to the next phase of the web build process: The [[revisions-phase]]

Google Search Console is a key part of [[the-digital-suite]] of services, but it's unique in that it's setup must take place after the site is live on the client's domain. Google Search Console enables us to expedite the indexing of the site with Google.

Adding a site to Google Search Console is us basically claiming ownership of it. This takes place during the [[go-live-phase.domain-dns-adjustments]] of the Go-Live phase, where you can add a TXT record that verifies ownership of a domain with Google. There are other methods of verification, but this one tends to work the best.

### After verifying ownership in Google Search Console:

-   [Submit the sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
    -   it's always www.client-domain.com/sitemap_index.xml
-   [Connect Search Console to Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10737381?hl=en)
-   [Connect Search Console to Google Ads](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7529561?hl=en)
-   Grant access to the property to the Copy dept by adding the following email as a user with 'Full' permissions: googlesearch@mandr-group.com

-   also add the site to [[the-digital-suite.bing-webmaster-tools]]
